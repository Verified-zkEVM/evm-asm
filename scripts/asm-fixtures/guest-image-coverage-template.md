# Guest-image CodeReq coverage accounting (bead evm-asm-4ch8f.63)

What fraction of the linked `stateless_guest` `.text` the composed
`guestImageCodeReq` (`EvmAsm/Codegen/Proofs/GuestImage.lean`, entries table
`GuestImageEntries.lean`) actually covers, and the precise list of what it
does NOT — every uncovered range is work someone must do before the `.64`
end-to-end theorem can run over the FULL image. Child beads under `.63`
track the clusters (§2).

**GENERATED FILE — do not hand-edit.** This document is rendered from
`scripts/asm-fixtures/guest-image-coverage-template.md` (prose and
placeholder slots only — no figures) plus live numbers from the generator:

```
python3 scripts/guest_image_coverage.py --write-doc   # regenerate THIS FILE
python3 scripts/guest_image_coverage.py --check-doc   # drift check
```

The drift check is wired into CI as `scripts/check-guest-image-coverage.sh`
in the `reports` lane of `scripts/check-build-parallel.sh`, so a layout or
manifest change that moves the §1 numbers or the §3 table without a
`--write-doc` regeneration fails the build. Other generator modes
(unchanged):

```
python3 scripts/guest_image_coverage.py            # human summary + gaps
python3 scripts/guest_image_coverage.py --md       # §1 numbers + §3 table to stdout
python3 scripts/guest_image_coverage.py --emit-lean  # GuestImageEntries.lean
```

Method: `.text` symbol extents come from the linker-facts table
(`scripts/asm-fixtures/symbol-addresses.tsv`, CI-drift-guarded); a symbol's
extent runs to the next symbol (or the `RegionMap.textSizeBytes` end). A
range is covered iff its symbol is a wave-.9 conversion
(`scripts/asm-fixtures/MANIFEST.tsv`) whose `_prog` length (the
kernel-checked `#guard <prog>.length` pin) fills the extent; a shorter
`_prog` leaves a `TAIL` gap, a longer one is an `OVERRUN` (hard error =
layout drift). The script asserts covered + gaps = `textSizeBytes` exactly.

Manifest entries whose entry symbol is NOT in the TSV are **converted but
not linked** (@@NOT_LINKED@@ of @@MANIFEST_TOTAL@@ today — gas helpers etc.
awaiting wiring); they are excluded from `guestImageEntries` (the image
`CodeReq` must reflect the emitted ELF) and are NOT gaps.

## 1. Summary

`.text` = [0x@@TEXT_BASE@@, 0x@@TEXT_END@@), @@TEXT_SIZE@@ bytes (`RegionMap.textSizeBytes = 0x@@TEXT_SIZE_HEX@@`)

- symbols in `.text`: @@N_SYMS@@ (@@N_CONV@@ converted, @@N_UNCONV@@ unconverted)
- covered by converted `_prog`s: @@COVERED_BYTES@@ bytes (@@COVERED_PCT@@%)
- NOT covered: @@GAP_BYTES@@ bytes (@@GAP_PCT@@%), @@N_GAPS@@ ranges

Everything covered is anchored BY NAME (`GuestAddrs.<entry>`), so layout
regens flow through `GuestAddrs.lean` without touching the entries table
(addresses) — only add/remove of functions or length changes regenerate it.
The kernel-checked extent fact `guestImageEntries_extentsOk`
(`GuestImage.lean`) is the whole-image disjointness certificate.
