  Structural checkpoint for #12300.  The strict LIST path is one mutual
  recursion, not three independent calls:

      shared -> validate_payload -> nested -> shared

  The index carried here is twice the number of bytes remaining in the current
  cursor window.  The constructors deliberately expose the three back-edges
  and require a cursor advance before each one.  The semantic postconditions
  are intentionally not in this checkpoint; this file establishes the
  well-founded shape that the eventual machine triple will consume.

/-! The three edge lemmas are the checkpoint's key obligation.  The LIST arm
    may also shrink the enclosing end pointer, so retain that stronger form in
    addition to the same-window cursor lemma above. -/

    proof may recurse through any of the three constructors only after applying
    the corresponding strict inequality above.  Keeping this checkpoint
    separate prevents a semantic postcondition from hiding a non-decreasing
    LIST arm. -/
